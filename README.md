# README

This is a planner Ruby on Rails application. If you are a fond Panda Planner user, then this will look very familiar to you. If you have no idea what a Panda Planner is, I would still recommend playing with this application to see if you have any use for it. 

## Instructions
To load this app, git clone, run "bundle install", "rake db:migrate", and then "rails s" to start the server. The next step would be to sign up as a user; you would provide an email and a password. Once you have done that step, you can get started by creating a month, week, or day. And that's it! Hope you enjoy using this application!
